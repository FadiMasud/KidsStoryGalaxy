        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Kids Story Galaxy does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data. All app data stays on your device. We have no servers, no accounts, and no tracking.
        </div>

        <h2>1. About This App</h2>
        <p>Kids Story Galaxy ("the App") is an interactive storybook application designed for children ages 3-12, featuring narrated stories, mini-games, coloring activities, and achievement badges. The App is developed and operated by:</p>
        <p><strong>Fadi Masud</strong><br>
        Email: <a href="mailto:support@cryptolive.blog">support@cryptolive.blog</a></p>
        <p>The App is available on the Apple App Store and is intended primarily for use by children under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

            <li>No analytics, diagnostics, or usage data transmitted off-device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>To provide its features, the App stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading progress, earned stars, and game scores</li>
            <li>Coloring artwork saved as images</li>
            <li>Achievement badges and reading streak history</li>
            <li>User preferences (selected language, theme, age group, narration settings)</li>
            <li>Subscription status (verified locally via Apple StoreKit)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored using standard iOS mechanisms (UserDefaults and the app's Documents directory). It is <strong>never transmitted, uploaded, or shared</strong> with any server, service, or third party. All local data can be completely removed by deleting the App from your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Kids Story Galaxy is designed for children and is listed in the Kids category on the Apple App Store. We take children's privacy extremely seriously and fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as it applies to children, and Apple's guidelines for Kids category apps.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No personal information is collected</strong> from children or any user - not even anonymized or aggregated data</li>
            <li><strong>No user accounts or login</strong> are required or available</li>
            <li><strong>No social features</strong> - no chat, messaging, forums, user-generated content sharing, or communication with other users</li>
            <li><strong>No behavioral tracking or profiling</strong> of any kind</li>
            <li><strong>No third-party analytics or advertising SDKs</strong> are included in the App</li>
            <li><strong>No data is transmitted</strong> to any external server, including our own</li>
            <li>Children <strong>cannot make any personal information publicly available</strong> through the App</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> condition a child's participation in any activity on providing personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since we collect absolutely no personal data, there is no data to review, delete, or restrict. However, if you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cryptolive.blog">support@cryptolive.blog</a> and we will promptly address your inquiry.</p>

        <h2>5. Parental Rights</h2>
        <p>As a parent or legal guardian, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review any personal information collected from your child - we collect none</li>
            <li>Request deletion of any personal information - we store none</li>
            <li>Refuse further collection of your child's information - we collect none</li>
            <li>Remove all locally stored app data by deleting the App from your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Purchasing features (subscriptions) are handled exclusively through Apple's App Store, which requires parental authentication (password, Face ID, or Touch ID). The App supports Apple's Ask to Buy feature for children's accounts managed through Family Sharing.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> integrate any third-party services for analytics, advertising, tracking, or data collection. The only external service interaction is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple App Store / StoreKit:</strong> Used solely for processing subscription purchases and verifying subscription status. This is handled entirely by Apple's operating system. We do not have access to your payment information, Apple ID, or any account details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or transmit any data, there is no risk of data breach from our services. All data stored locally on your device is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID, encryption).</p>

        <h2>8. International Users (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions with data protection laws:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> We do not process any personal data. No legal basis is required as no data collection occurs.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Subject Rights:</strong> You have the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, port, and object to the processing of your personal data. Since we collect no personal data, these rights are satisfied by default.</li>

            <li><strong>Right to Complain:</strong> You may lodge a complaint with your local data protection supervisory authority at any time.</li>
